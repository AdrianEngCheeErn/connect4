# Connect4  

## How To Run Game  
Download ZIP, and run the main.py file on your local IDEs like VS Code or PyCharm  

## CPU Bots  
I made the hard level CPU bot's algorithm from scratch, which checks for the different conditions sequentially base on the impact and importance of the condition. There are well defined algorithms for this game already such as minimax or negamax, but I wanted to make my own algorithm to test my skills.
